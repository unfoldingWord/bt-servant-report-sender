# =============================================================================
# LAYERED ARCHITECTURE CONTRACT
# Enforces one-way dependencies: outer layers can import inner layers.
#
# Layer order (outer to inner):
#   cli -> services -> parsers -> models
#
# What this means:
# - cli CAN import services, parsers, models
# - services CAN import parsers, models (NOT cli)
# - parsers CAN import models (NOT cli, services)
# - models CAN'T import anything above
#
# Note: This contract will be refined as the project architecture develops.
